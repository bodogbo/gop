# GOP

GOP is a project manangement tool for golang application projects which you can place it anywhere(not in the GOPATH). Also this means it's not go-getable. GOP copy all denpendencies to src directory and all application's source is also in this directory. 

So a common process is below:

```
git clone xxx@mydata.com:bac/aaa.git
cd aaa
gop ensure
gop build
gop test
```

## Installation

Please ensure you have install the `go` command, GOP  will invoke it on building or testing

```
go get github.com/lunny/gop
```
